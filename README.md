Graduate Admission Prediction using ANN

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting graduate admission probabilities using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model is trained on historical data of graduate applicants, incorporating various features such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and letters of recommendation. By leveraging ANN, it aims to provide accurate predictions that assist prospective graduate students in understanding their likelihood of admission.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is available in the `data` directory. It is in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format.

This dataset is tailored for predicting graduate admissions from an Indian perspective, focusing on parameters typically considered crucial during applications for Masters programs.
